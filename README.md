Nand2Tetris Hardware
====================

Keeping track as I work through the hardware projects of the 
[NandToTetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course:

+ Project 1: Boolean Logic
+ Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic
+ Project 3: Sequential Logic
+ Project 4: Machine Language
+ Project 5: Computer Architecture

I expect this repo to provide guidance and facilitate comparison to other 
learners out there. 

I encourage you to delve into the freely available lectures at 
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) or explore the related book.
